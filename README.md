### Userscript allowing custom emojis in the My Anon Mouse shoutboxâ„¢

### How can I add emojis?

It's pretty simple, edit the first variable in the script, `var emojis = {...}`. As you see, it contains already some pairs (for example `"hap":"https://image.jeuxvideo.com/smileys_img/18.gif"`). You can delete and add your own, like this: `"name of your emoji":"url to image"`. Remember to separate entries with commas, like in the provided example.
